# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview of the Project
### Purpose 
In this project, we utilized unsupervized machine learning to analyze cryptocurrency data. Accountability Accounting wants to offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers and through our research Accountability Accounting will hopefully have a better insight on cryptocurrency. We have made a report that includes what crytocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
